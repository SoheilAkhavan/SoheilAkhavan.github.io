        - Adversarial examples capable of fooling image classifiers generated 
          ex. adversarial examples to fool MNIST classifier, examples to fool
          finetuned VGG16 in CIFAR-10).
        - Provided an observational and theoretical justification that a change 
          orthogonal to the feature space can lead to adversarial examples.
        - Wrote codes and detailed explanations on state-of-the art adversarial example
          generation mechanisms including: Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM), 
          Jacobian-Based Saliency Map Method, and Carlini-Wagner Method.  
        - Evaluated the performance of the defense mechanisms of:
          Adversarial Training and Defense Distillation. 

    - role: Kaggle Competitions

        - Participated in 10 different competitions
        - Vision: Developed image classifiers using transfer learning. 
          In particular, finetuning ResNet-50 for competitions including 
          'Dog vs. Cat' (achieved accuracy: 99.7%, training time: less than 10 minutes)
        - Structure Data (Rossmann Store Competition): TriedRegression analysis, 
          Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Trees. My proposed fully connected NN with capability 
          of learning embeddings for categorical variables reached a loss value at rank 10. 
        - Time Series: Performing time-series analysis through NN by supplying time features 
          into the model as an approach easier than the traditional statistical time series models.
